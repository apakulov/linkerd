# FAQ

## How do I get to the linkerd admin page?

The admin page by default can be accessed at http://localhost:9990. You may
also specify the port as part of the linkerd config.

## Where can I get raw performance metrics from linkerd?

linkerd exposes machine-friendly metrics in JSON format at
http://localhost:9990/admin/metrics.json.

## Where do linkerd logs go?

By default, linkerd logs to the local `logs/` directory. linkerd access logging
is configured via the `routers/httpAccessLog` key in the config file. stdout
and stderr logging is configured via the `PROCESS_LOG_FILE` in the `linkerd`
file. The two logs produced by linkerd are as follows:

* `access.log`: An httpd style log of HTTP requests
* `linkerd.log`: Application-specific logging from linkerd itself

## How does linkerd handle service errors?

Errors generated by downstream services are passed through linkerd unmodified.

For HTTP, errors are served with the `text/plain` `Content-type` & an
explanatory error message is available in both the response body and the
`Buoy-err` header.

When the configured namers cannot resolve a service to handle the request,
linkerd responds with `400 Bad Request`. This could be caused by misconfiguration
of linkerd, problems with service discovery, or by an incorrect `Dtab-local`
header attached to the request.

All other failures communicating with downstream services (including timeouts,
inability to establish a connection, etc.) are represented as `503 Bad
Gateway`.
